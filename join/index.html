          <h2>Join the team</h2>
          <p>
            If you're located in the southwest Washington state area, of Finnish
            descent, and interested in joining the team, please contact Joel
            Mattila. You can contact him on LinkedIn or Facebook. We won't put
            contact information here to avoid spam.
          </p>
          <p>
            We have a limited amount of spots available, so we can't guarantee a
            spot on the team. Seasons are Fall, Spring, and sometimes Summer.
            Fall is the longest, then Spring, and Summer is the shortest and
            most casual. We play every Saturday night at Mountain View Ice Arena
            in Vancouver, Washington.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition to our Rec team (beginners), we also have a C/CC team
            for more advanced players.
          </p>
          <h2>Requirements</h2>
          <p>
            For Rec League, you should know the basics of skating and handling a
            puck, the basics of team hockey play, the rules, and be able to
            commit to a weekly Saturday night game schedule.
          </p>
          <p>
            You'll be expected to buy your own gear and pay the league fees,
            which range from $400-600 per season. You'll have to buy a jersey
            and socks (talk to Joel).
          </p>
          <p>
            Ideally, you'll have gone through the rink's adult skating and
            hockey classes before joining the team.
          </p>
          <p>
            Hockey isn't a cheap sport, but it's a lot of fun and there's great
            comradery. You'll probably spend a couple grand or more getting
            started, so just be aware of that.
          </p>
          <h2>Conduct</h2>
          <p>
            Suomi Poikas players should conduct themselves with respect toward
            the ice arena, officials, teammates, opponents, and fans. We expect
            players to be good sportsmen and sportswomen. We also expect players
            and our fans to be good citizens and good representatives of the
            Finnish community.
