# Historical Data

This is just a dump of Mountain View's standings pages from older seasons. The accuracy is not great, but it's all we have, generally speaking.

Note: You can access old standings by going here:

https://mountainview.ezleagues.ezfacility.com/schedule.aspx?facility_id=2042&d=9%2f9%2f2022&framed=1

...and using the calendar to find older gamedays, and then following the links from there to the standings / team pages.
