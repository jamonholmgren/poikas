        "We had a great season, finishing the regular season at 13-2-1, but the Slavic Peeps were our achilles heel. We faced them for the fourth time in a row in the championship game and fell short this time. But it was a fantastic season nonetheless, a lot of growth from our young guys, a huge defensive effort, and we had a record 7 shutouts throughout the season.",
