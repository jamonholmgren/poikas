In the playoffs, we played against the #3 Thundersticks, which we had been 0-3 against in the regular season, and the #1 Slavic Peeps (Russians), which we went 1-2 against. We squeaked out a narrow 3-1 win against the Thundersticks and moved on to the Slavic Peeps for the Championship. We went down 0-2 early but battled back in front of a packed house to win it 5-3 for our fourth championship!",
